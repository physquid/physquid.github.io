Every realistic instance of a percolation problem is faced with some degree of polydispersity, e.g., the pore size distribution of an inhomogeneous medium, the size distribution of filler particles in composite materials, or the vertex degree of agents in a community network. Such polydispersity is a welcome, because simple to perform, generalization of many theoretical approaches deployed to predict percolation thresholds. These theoretical studies independently found very similar conceptual results for vastly different systems, namely, that the percolation threshold is insensitive to the particular distribution controlling the polydispersity and rather depends only on the first few moments of the distribution. In this article we explain this frequently observed pattern using branching processes. The key observation is that a reasonable degree of polydispersity does effectively not alter the structure of the network that forms at the percolation threshold. As a consequence, the critical parameters of the monodisperse system can be analytically continued to account for polydispersity.
