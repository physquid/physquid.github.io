We propose a simple percolation criterion for arbitrary percolation problems. The basic idea is to decompose the system of interest into a hierarchy of neighborhoods, such that the percolation problem can be expressed as a branching process. The criterion provides the exact percolation thresholds for a large number of exactly solved percolation problems, including random graphs, small-world networks, bond percolation on two-dimensional lattices with a triangular hypergraph, and site percolation on two-dimensional lattices with a generalized triangular hypergraph, as well as specific continuum percolation problems. The fact that the range of applicability of the criterion is so large bears the remarkable implication that all the listed problems are effectively treelike. With this in mind, we transfer the exact solutions known from duality to random lattices and site-bond percolation problems and introduce a method to generate simple planar lattices with a prescribed percolation threshold.
