## About Me

I am a statistical physicist broadly interested in complex systems, soft matter, and interdisciplinary applications of theoretical physics. 
My PhD thesis develops a general framework for the exact determination or systematic approximation of percolation thresholds for systems in thermal equilibrium, with applications to materials-science problems concerning carbon black aggregates with a fractal structure.

I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the interdisciplinary *Physics of Fixational Eye Movements* (PhysFEM) project, a collaboration between theoretical physicists, neuroscientists, and psychologists the University of Oxford, the University of Leeds, and the University of Pennsylvania. 
The project is funded by UKRI and the Wellcome Trust under the call "Physics of Life: Building Collaboration at the Life Sciences Interface". 
More information is available on the [project website](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/perception-lab/projects/physics-of-fixational-eye-movements-physfem).
